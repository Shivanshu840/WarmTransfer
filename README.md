## Detailed Warm Transfer Workflow

### Overview

The warm transfer process allows Agent A to seamlessly hand off a customer call to Agent B with full context preservation. Here's how it works step by step:

### Phase 1: Initial Customer Contact

**1. Customer Initiates Call**
- Customer opens http://localhost:3000
- Enters their name in the call interface
- Clicks "Start New Call"
- System creates a unique call session and LiveKit room

**2. Agent A Joins Automatically**
- Backend automatically assigns Agent A to the call
- Agent A interface shows connected status
- Voice connection established via LiveKit WebRTC

**3. Call Context Begins**
- Call session ID created for tracking
- Initial context logged: "Call started with customer [name]"

### Phase 2: Conversation and Context Capture

**4. Agent A Captures Real-Time Context**
- Agent A uses the "Add Call Context" section during conversation
- Examples of context input:
  - "Customer has billing issue with payment declined"
  - "Technical problem - React app not loading, 404 error"
  - "Refund request for order #12345, damaged item"
- Each context entry is timestamped and stored
- Context appears in local history for Agent A to review

**5. Context Storage**
- All context sent to backend via `/api/add-context` endpoint
- Backend stores context with session ID and speaker identification
- Context used later for AI summary generation

### Phase 3: Transfer Decision and Initiation

**6. Agent A Decides to Transfer**
- Agent A determines customer needs specialized help
- In Transfer Panel, Agent A enters Agent B name (e.g., "Random")
- Clicks "Initiate Transfer"

**7. Backend Processing and AI Summary Generation**
- Backend receives transfer request with session ID and Agent B ID
- **LLM GENERATES CONTEXT HERE:** Backend calls `/api/initiate-transfer` endpoint
- System retrieves all stored context from the call session
- LLM (Groq/OpenAI) processes the context using this prompt:
  ```
  "You are an AI assistant that creates concise call summaries for warm transfers. 
  Summarize the key points, customer needs, and context that would be helpful 
  for the next agent."
  ```
- AI generates comprehensive call summary from all captured context
- Generated summary stored in call session data
- System creates private "transfer room" for agent briefing
- Transfer notification created for Agent B

**8. Transfer Room Creation**
- Unique transfer room created: `transfer_[session]_[random]`
- Tokens generated for both agents to join transfer room
- Agent A receives transfer room credentials

### Phase 4: Agent Briefing Phase

**9. Agent B Notification**
- Agent B dashboard (http://localhost:3000/agent-b) polls for notifications every 2 seconds
- System displays incoming transfer notification with orange alert
- Notification includes:
  - Transfer room ID
  - Session information
  - Timestamp
  - "Accept Transfer" button

**10. Agents Join Transfer Room**
- Agent B clicks "Accept Transfer" and joins private transfer room
- Agent A also joins the same transfer room
- Both agents now in private conversation (customer cannot hear)

**11. Context Sharing**
- AI-generated call summary displayed to both agents
- Summary includes:
  - Customer name
  - Main issues discussed
  - Specific problems mentioned
  - Current status and next steps needed
- Agent A provides additional verbal context if needed

### Phase 5: Transfer Completion

**12. Agent A Completes Transfer**
- When briefing is complete, Agent A clicks "Complete Transfer"
- Backend generates token for Agent B to join original customer room
- Completion notification sent to Agent B with customer room details

**13. Automatic Agent B Connection**
- Agent B automatically connects to customer room
- Agent B interface shows "Customer Call Active" status
- Voice connection established between Agent B and customer
- Call timer starts for Agent B

**14. Agent A Graceful Exit**
- Agent A can leave customer room (customer continues with Agent B)
- Original call session marked as "transferred"
- Agent A's work is complete

### Phase 6: Continued Customer Support

**15. Agent B Takes Over**
- Agent B now handles customer conversation
- Full context available from AI summary
- Customer experiences seamless transition
- Agent B can add additional context if needed

**16. Call Resolution**
- Agent B resolves customer issue
- Agent B can end call when complete, or
- Customer can end call themselves
- Session marked as completed

### Phase 7: Optional External Transfer (Twilio)

**17. Transfer to External Phone (Optional)**
- If needed, Agent A or B can transfer to external phone number
- Enter phone number in "Transfer to Phone" section
- Click "Transfer via Twilio"
- System calls external number and plays AI-generated summary

### Technical Flow Details

**API Calls During Transfer:**
1. `POST /api/create-call` - Create initial session
2. `POST /api/add-context` - Add conversation context (multiple times)
3. `POST /api/initiate-transfer` - Start transfer process
4. `GET /api/notifications/{agent_id}` - Agent B polls for notifications
5. `POST /api/complete-transfer` - Complete the handoff
6. `POST /api/agent-exit-room` - Agent A leaves customer room

**LiveKit Room Flow:**
1. **Customer Room:** `call_[random]` - Customer + Agent A initially
2. **Transfer Room:** `transfer_[session]_[random]` - Agent A + Agent B briefing  
3. **Customer Room:** `call_[random]` - Customer + Agent B finally

**Data Flow:**
- Context stored in backend memory with session ID
- AI processes context into readable summary
- Notifications stored per agent ID for polling
- Session state tracked throughout transfer process

### Error Handling

**Common Scenarios:**
- **Agent B Offline:** Transfer notification persists until Agent B comes online
- **Connection Loss:** Participants can rejoin using same tokens
- **Transfer Timeout:** Transfer can be retried with same context
- **Customer Disconnects:** Both agents notified, session ended

**Recovery Mechanisms:**
- Session state preserved in backend memory
- Room tokens remain valid for reconnection
- Context preserved even if transfer fails
- Manual reset available via Agent B "Reset" button

This workflow ensures customers receive uninterrupted service while agents maintain complete context throughout the handoff process.
